# Context

* The system to be implemented consists of a backend and frontend.
* I provide a server with Ubuntu 24.04 and amd64 architecture.
* On the server Podman is installed to host the needed services.
* The myTracks app will communicate with the backend using a REST API.
* The user that gets the link only uses the link to view the track in a webbrowser. No end user will use the REST API.
